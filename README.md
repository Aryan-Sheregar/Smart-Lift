Welcome to Smart Lift - your solution for optimizing lift operations in multi-floor buildings!

**Introduction**
The Smart Lift project is designed to enhance the efficiency and user experience of lift operations by leveraging advanced face detection technology. Traditional elevator systems often suffer from inefficiencies and long wait times, especially during peak hours. Smart Lift addresses these challenges by automating lift button presses based on real-time occupancy data obtained through face recognition.

**Key Features**
**Automated Lift Button Management**: Smart Lift automatically manages lift button presses based on the presence of individuals at each floor's lift lobby. When someone is detected waiting for the elevator, the system presses the appropriate lift buttons to summon the nearest available lift.
**Real-Time Occupancy Monitoring**: Utilizing sophisticated face detection algorithms, Smart Lift continuously monitors each floor's lift lobby for the presence of occupants. This ensures timely response to lift requests and minimizes wait times for building occupants.
**Efficiency and Energy Savings**: By intelligently managing lift operations, Smart Lift optimizes lift utilization and reduces unnecessary lift dispatches. This not only improves efficiency but also conserves energy and reduces operational costs.
**Enhanced User Experience**: With Smart Lift, occupants experience reduced wait times, improved elevator responsiveness, and a seamless lift journey. The system enhances user satisfaction and convenience, contributing to a more pleasant building experience.

**How it Works**
**Face Detection**: Smart Lift employs face detection technology to detect individuals waiting at each floor's lift lobby.
**LED Feedback**: RGB LED indicators provide visual feedback on lift availability and status, enhancing communication and user experience.

**Tech Stack**
**Programming Languages**: Python
**Computer Vision Libraries**: OpenCV
**Hardware Components**: Raspberry Pi 4, Webcam, RGB LEDs.
